Flex is used to arrange elements in single direction i.e., row or column

Always flex should be defined to the parent element

Default direction for flex is row
Parent Properties:
display:flex
flex-direction:row/column/row-reverse/column-reverse
justify-content:left/right/start/end/center/space-around/space-between/space-evenly(horizontally)
it arranges elements in same direction as flex direction
align-items:left/right/start/end/center(vertically)
it arranges elements in opposite direction of flex 
gap: it is used to define gap between the elements
flex-wrap:nowrap/wrap/wrap-reverse
it is used to wrap up the elements until their width/height such that new lines will form
align-content: left/right/start/end/center/space-around/space-between/space-evenly(vertical)
it is used to arrange the lines formed by flex wrap

child Properties:
flex-grow: it is the measurement to increase an element when gap is available
flex-shrink: it is the measurement to decrease an element when gap is not available
flex-basis: it is the fixed size of an element irrespective of gap
order: order is the number by which all elements are arranged and default order is 0

 Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a CSS layout module that makes it easier to align,
distribute, and position elements inside a container, especially when designing responsive web pages.

Why Use Flexbox?
✅ Easier alignment (horizontal & vertical centering)
✅ Automatic resizing of elements
✅ Equal spacing between items
✅ Works great for both small & large layouts
✅ Better handling of dynamic content

When to Use Flexbox?
✅ Navigation bars
✅ Card layouts
✅ Centering elements easily
✅ Grid-like structures

The max-content property in CSS is used for defining the width or height of an element based on the longest content inside it.
It ensures that the element expands just enough to fit its content without wrapping or breaking.

When to Use max-content?
✅ Prevent text from wrapping unnecessarily
✅ Make buttons, cards, or text boxes auto-size based on content
✅ Ensure consistent layout without hardcoding width/height

Difference Between align-items and align-content in Flexbox
When working with CSS Flexbox, both align-items and align-content are used for vertical alignment,
 but they behave differently depending on whether the flex container has extra space.

 1️⃣ align-items → Aligns items along the Cross Axis (Single Line)
Works on individual flex items.
Aligns items within the flex container along the cross axis.
Affects all items in a single row.
Works whether or not there's extra space.

2️⃣ align-content → Aligns Lines in Multi-Line Flexbox
Works only when flex-wrap is enabled (i.e., multiple lines of flex items).
Controls how multiple rows (or columns) are spaced inside the flex container.
Requires flex-wrap: wrap; and extra space in the container.

Property	   Works On  	     Requires Flex-Wrap?	   Works With Extra Space?	    Best Used When
align-items	  Individual items	 ❌ No	  ❌ No              (Works anytime)	             Aligning single-line items
align-content Rows/Columns	     ✅ Yes	  ✅ Yes             (Needs extra space)	         Aligning multiple lines
